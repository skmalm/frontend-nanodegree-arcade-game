# Classic Arcade Game Clone

Basic clone of the classic arcade game Frogger. This was built as a project for Udacity's Front End Web Development Nanodegree.

## How to Play

Use the arrow keys to move the player character. Try to reach the water without hitting any bugs! If you hit a bug, you lose and your player character's position will be reset. If you reach the water, you have won and your player character's position will also be reset.

===============================

Students should use this [rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/projects/2696458597/rubric) for self-checking their submission. Make sure the functions you write are **object-oriented** - either class functions (like Player and Enemy) or class prototype functions such as Enemy.prototype.checkCollisions, and that the keyword 'this' is used appropriately within your class and class prototype functions to refer to the object the function is called upon. Also be sure that the **readme.md** file is updated with your instructions on both how to 1. Run and 2. Play your arcade game.

For detailed instructions on how to get started, check out this [guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1v01aScPjSWCCWQLIpFqvg3-vXLH2e8_SZQKC8jNO0Dc/pub?embedded=true).
